The Postgraduate Departmental Academic Committee (PG-DAC) must approve internship feasibility recommendations for students. If approved, the student will be assigned a departmental supervisor and potentially an external co-supervisor from the internship organization. The PG-DAC consists of the Head (Chairperson), two senior faculty members from the PG specialization, an external observer (Professor from another department), and the PG Coordinator/Faculty Advisor (Convenor). For the M. Tech. program, semester examinations (theory and practical) are conducted at the end of each semester (November-December and April-May in the first academic year), known as End Semester Exams (ESE). Mid Semester Exams (MSE) are also held during these semesters.

Continuous evaluation for end-semester examinations is worth 40 marks and can be distributed among class work, lab records, quizzes, skill tests, assignments, and mini-projects. Mid-semester evaluations include practical performance and viva-voce. For projects, a maximum of four students can be assigned per project. The Head of Department appoints a project coordinator who, with faculty consultation, creates a list of project topics by the start of the 7th semester. The project evaluation committee (PrC) consists of the Head of Department (or nominee as Chairman), project coordinator, and project guide(s). Project allocation, guide assignment, and a tentative work plan must be finalized before the last day of the 6th semester.

The Cumulative Performance Index (CPI) and Semester Performance Index (SPI) are calculated using the formula: SPI = Σ(Course credit × Grade point) / Σ(Course credit) for all courses in a semester. CPI = Σ(Course credit × Grade point) / Σ(Course credit) for all passed courses across all completed semesters. Grade points are recorded up to two decimal places without rounding off. Grade sheets with CPI and SPI are issued at the end of each semester, except for the final semester (VIIIth semester for B. Tech.), where a consolidated grade sheet is issued, superseding all previous ones. Teacher's assessment, a component of the continuous assessment process, includes class tests, assignments, viva-voce, quizzes, and laboratory assignments.

Students who receive an 'F' grade must retake the course until a passing grade is achieved. An 'F' grade can extend the time needed to complete degree requirements. If a student receives one or more 'F' grades in a semester, their Semester Performance Index (SPI) for that semester will not be calculated. Students absent from end-semester examinations due to valid reasons will receive an 'NA' grade. An 'NA' grade in any subject will result in a zero SPI and Cumulative Performance Index (CPI) for that semester until the course is cleared. Students must take a supplementary examination to convert 'NA' to a passing grade. Failure to appear in the supplementary examination will result in an 'R' grade.

Mid-semester and supplementary exams are conducted by departments according to the academic calendar. At least two syllabus units must be completed before the mid-semester exam. End-semester exams are typically held centrally. Students unable to attend mid-semester exams due to serious illness (requiring hospitalization/bed rest, with intimation to the medical officer) or family calamity must apply to the Head of Department within one week of the exam period, with supporting certificates. The Departmental Academic Committee (DAC) will review these cases, and approved students will be permitted to retake the exam.

To pass a semester as a B.Tech student, you need to avoid receiving an 'F' or 'NA' grade in any course.

*   **'F' Grade:** If you receive an 'F' grade in a course, you must retake that course until you achieve a passing grade. An 'F' grade will prevent the calculation of your Semester Performance Index (SPI) for that semester.
*   **'NA' Grade:** An 'NA' grade is given if you are absent from the end-semester examination due to valid reasons. An 'NA' grade in any subject will result in a zero SPI and Cumulative Performance Index (CPI) for that semester until the course is cleared. You must take a supplementary examination to convert an 'NA' to a passing grade. Failure to appear in the supplementary examination will result in an 'R' grade.

Additionally, you need a minimum of 75% attendance (including condonation) in each course to be eligible to appear for the end-semester examination.

The Cumulative Performance Index (CPI) and Semester Performance Index (SPI) are calculated using the formula: SPI = Σ(Course credit × Grade point) / Σ(Course credit) for all courses in a semester. CPI = Σ(Course credit × Grade point) / Σ(Course credit) for all passed courses across all completed semesters. Grade points are recorded up to two decimal places without rounding off. Grade sheets with CPI and SPI are issued at the end of each semester, except for the final semester (VIIIth semester for B. Tech.), where a consolidated grade sheet is issued, superseding all previous ones. Teacher's assessment, a component of the continuous assessment process, includes class tests, assignments, viva-voce, quizzes, and laboratory assignments.

The class average excludes marks of students with an F grade. Transitional grading symbols include NA (incomplete assessment), R (insufficient attendance, course repeat required), W (temporary withdrawal), and X (debarred for malpractice or indiscipline). An O grade signifies outstanding achievement, while an E grade represents average performance and the minimum passing grade. An F grade indicates failure, requiring the student to repeat the course.

The evaluation pattern for theory courses includes 20 marks for continuous assessment (class tests, quizzes, assignments, tutorials), 30 marks for the mid-semester exam, and 50 marks for the end-semester exam. Laboratory courses have a continuous assessment of 100 marks, with 40 marks for continuous evaluation (TA) and 20 marks for the mid-semester evaluation.

To be eligible for First Division with Distinction, a student must pass all courses without R, X, F, or W grades, without dropping any courses, and achieve a CPI of 8.5 or above. Failing to meet these criteria, even with a CPI of 8.5 or more, results in an award of First Division only. A CPI between 6.5 and 8.5 earns a First Division, while a CPI between 5.0 and 6.5 earns a Second Division. Valued answer scripts are preserved for 12 months after results are published.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[ASSISTANT]
The grading system for B.Tech students is based on a ten-point scale, with letter grades assigned considering marks from Teacher's Assessment (TA), Mid-Semester Exams (MSE), and End-Semester Exams (ESE).

Here's a breakdown:

**Grades and their implications:**
*   **O:** Outstanding achievement.
*   **E:** Represents average performance and is the minimum passing grade.
*   **F:** Indicates failure. If you receive an 'F' grade, you must repeat the course, and your Semester Performance Index (SPI) for that semester will not be calculated.
*   **NA:** Incomplete assessment, typically due to absence from end-semester examinations for valid reasons. An 'NA' grade results in a zero SPI and Cumulative Performance Index (CPI) for that semester until the course is cleared through a supplementary examination.
*   **R:** Signifies insufficient attendance, requiring the course to be repeated.
*   **W:** Denotes temporary withdrawal from a course.
*   **X:** Means debarred for malpractice or indiscipline.

**Performance Indices:**
*   **Semester Performance Index (SPI):** Calculated as Σ(Course credit × Grade point) / Σ(Course credit) for all courses in a semester.
*   **Cumulative Performance Index (CPI):** Calculated as Σ(Course credit × Grade point) / Σ(Course credit) for all passed courses across all completed semesters.

**Divisions based on CPI:**
*   **First Division with Distinction:** Awarded if a student passes all courses without R, X, F, or W grades, without dropping any courses, and achieves a CPI of 8.5 or above.
*   **First Division:** Awarded for a CPI between 6.5 and 8.5 (or if a student has a CPI of 8.5 or more but does not meet all criteria for Distinction).
*   **Second Division:** Awarded for a CPI between 5.0 and 6.5.

Credits for a course are earned only upon obtaining a passing grade (not R, F, or W).

The Chairman of the Senate has the final authority on the duration of a degree, including any gap periods, which count towards the maximum permissible time. Failure to complete the required process may lead to admission cancellation. The B. Tech. degree program normally spans eight semesters (four years), with English as the medium of instruction and examination. The teaching scheme generally includes Lecture (L), Tutorial (T), and Practical (P) components, with credits assigned per period per week. Changes to syllabi, up to one unit, require approval from the Departmental Academic Committee (DAC).

Students must clear backlog papers prioritizing the oldest ones. A maximum of seven theory subjects, including backlogs, can be registered per semester. Once a semester examination is passed, reappearing for improvement is not allowed. The B. Tech. program normally takes four years (eight semesters) to complete. However, students facing academic difficulties have a maximum of seven years (14 consecutive semesters) to fulfill all degree requirements.

Revisions to syllabi require approval from the Departmental Academic Committee (DAC) and the Senate. The B.Tech. program structure includes Essential Program Requirements (EPR), Programme Core (PC), Elective Courses (PE and OE), and Programme Laboratory Requirements (PLR). All B.Tech. programs mandate 4-6 weeks of industrial training or fieldwork, to be completed before degree eligibility. This training is typically undertaken during the summer vacation after the fourth and sixth semesters.

A minimum of 177 earned credits are required for the 4-year B. Tech. program. The Performance Index is calculated based on course credits and grades, with a minimum required for satisfactory progress and program continuation. Credits are calculated as {L+T+P/2}, rounded up to the nearest whole number. A student must pass a semester to earn all its credits. A grade of 'E' or higher is the minimum passing grade for a course.

Students withdrawing from the institute must clear all outstanding dues. No fees paid will be refunded. Students who received scholarships or financial assistance must repay these amounts. The Director and Chairman, Senate's decision on withdrawal is final. Students admitted to a B.Tech. program typically continue in that branch. However, the Institute may allow a change of branch at the end of the first two semesters if vacancies exist, following MHRD guidelines. Specific rules for branch change are detailed in Annexure-I.

A 'W' grade signifies withdrawal from the semester. Students can withdraw from a course until the mid-semester examination begins. An 'R' grade is given for insufficient attendance, requiring the student to repeat the course. Student performance is measured by the Semester Performance Index (SPI) and Cumulative Performance Index (CPI), calculated based on grades in registered courses for the semester and all completed semesters, respectively. Both SPI and CPI are recorded to two decimal places without rounding.

Students with attendance shortages must re-register for the course when it is next offered. For absences up to two weeks, students must submit a leave application with supporting documents to the Head of Department, who will grant the leave. Students will be marked absent during this period and must still meet the 75% attendance requirement for end-semester examinations. Continuous absence must be reported immediately to the Dean (Academics) through the Head of Department. Course teachers will inform students of their attendance status regularly.
